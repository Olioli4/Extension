merdeeee
- Always write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Use modularization: break code into small, reusable functions and components.
- Follow the project's coding style and naming conventions.
- Write meaningful commit messages and keep commits focused.
- Use version control best practices (feature branches, pull requests, code reviews).
- **Always resume code changes before editing and always ask for OK before editing the code.**

## Project Structure

- Organize code into logical folders (e.g., `src/`, `test/`, `docs/`, `assets/`).
- Place documentation in `README.md` and update it as the project evolves.
- Store configuration and environment files separately from source code.

## Documentation

- Every module, class, and function should have a clear docstring or comment explaining its purpose and usage.
- Update `README.md` with setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- Document any non-obvious design decisions or dependencies.

## Testing

- Write automated tests for all critical functionality.
- Place tests in a dedicated `test/` folder, mirroring the structure of `src/`.
- Use descriptive test names and include edge cases.

## Collaboration

- Communicate changes and design decisions with the team.
- Review and test code before merging.
- Respect existing code and refactor only with clear justification.

## Automation

- Use scripts or tasks for common workflows (build, test, lint, deploy).
- Document all automation in a dedicated `automation/` folder.
